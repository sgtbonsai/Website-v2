# My personal website

This is my personal website, made with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. In this readme, you will find information about each page and how I developed it (very redundant, i know). 

# index.html

This page is only here to redirect the website to /home since that's where all the content is. Why did I make this the homepage, who knows?

# /home

This is the home page.

# /projects

Explains all the projects that I am currently working on or have worked on in the past.

# /comet

Explains what my Discord bot, Comet, does. This also contains the invite link for the bot.

# /socials

Showcases all my social medias.

# /weather

An unfinished page that is currently under development.

# /rcg

Stands for Random County Generator, which randomly selects a county in the United States and displays it. This will gain wikipeida functionality in the future. Thanks to [Daniel Kravec](https://github.com/dkravec) for helping me with this.
